Vite React Setup Automation
===========================

This script automates the process of creating a Vite React app with a single command. It performs the following tasks:

-   Creates a new Vite React app.
-   Installs the necessary dependencies.
-   Starts the development server.
-   Opens the project in VS Code.

This guide includes setup instructions for **macOS** and **Linux**.

* * * * *

Prerequisites
-------------

-   **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed. You can verify by running:
```
    node -v
    npm -v
```

    If not installed, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) or use a package manager like `brew` (macOS) or `apt` (Linux).

-   **npm**: The script uses npm to install dependencies, so make sure it is installed as part of Node.js.

-   **VS Code**: The script opens the project in VS Code, so you need to have VS Code installed and the `code` command available in your terminal.

Setup Instructions
------------------

### **macOS**

1.  **Create the Script**

    -   Open your terminal and create the script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the project name is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: vite-react <project-name>"
  exit 1
fi

# Create the Vite React project (with the react template directly specified)
npm create vite@latest $1 --template react --no-interactive

# Navigate into the project directory
cd $1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server in the background
npm run dev &

# Open the project in VS Code
code .

```

    
6.  **Make the Script Executable**


   ``` chmod +x ~/vite-react.sh```

7.  **Move the Script to a Directory in PATH**

    ```sudo mv ~/vite-react.sh /usr/local/bin/vite-react```

8.  **Ensure VS Code is Installed**

    -   To install VS Code, you can use `brew`:

        ```brew install --cask visual-studio-code```

### **Linux**

1.  **Create the Script**

    -   Open your terminal and create the script:

        ```nano ~/vite-react.sh```

2.  **Add the Script Content** Copy and paste the same script:

    ```#!/bin/bash

    # Check if the project name is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
      echo "Usage: vite-react <project-name>"
      exit 1
    fi

    # Create the Vite React project (with the react template directly specified)
    npm create vite@latest $1 --template react --no-interactive

    # Navigate into the project directory
    cd $1

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the development server in the background
    npm run dev &

    # Open the project in VS Code
    code .```

3.  **Make the Script Executable**

    ```chmod +x ~/vite-react.sh```

4.  **Move the Script to a Directory in PATH**
5.  
    ```sudo mv ~/vite-react.sh /usr/local/bin/vite-react```

6.  **Ensure VS Code is Installed**

    -   For Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```sudo apt install code```

    -   For Fedora:
    -   
        ```sudo dnf install code```

* * * * *

Usage
-----

After following the setup steps, you can use the script to create a new Vite React app by running the following command:


```vite-react <project-name>```

Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your new project. For example:

```vite-react my-awesome-app```

This command will:

1.  Create the Vite React project using the React template.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies.
3.  Start the development server.
4.  Open the project in VS Code.

* * * * *

Troubleshooting
---------------

-   If you encounter any issues with VS Code not opening, make sure the `code` command is available in your terminal. You can verify this by running:

    ```code --version```

    If it's not available, follow the [installation instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

-   If the script fails, make sure you have `npm` and `Node.js` properly installed, and check if there are any permission issues with the script.

* * * * *

Conclusion
----------

This script simplifies the process of setting up a new Vite React project. It automates multiple steps, saving you time and making the process more streamlined.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
